# 🧬 Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to accurately predict breast cancer diagnoses as either **malignant** or **benign** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `breast_data.csv` - Dataset used for model training and evaluation.
- `Breast Cancer Diagnosis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with complete EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset Details

- **Source**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset  
- **Features**: 30 numerical features describing cell nuclei characteristics  
- **Target**: Diagnosis (`M` = Malignant, `B` = Benign)

## 🛠️ Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest Classifier  

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
